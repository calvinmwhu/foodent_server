Foodent (short for Food-Event)is a web app that aims at connecting hungry people to generous people who are willing to shared their food with each other. The platform allows user to become a host who can freely create food events and invite other people to join. It also allows user to become a guest so that it can freely browse food events happening around it. As a guest, user can join an "open" event or request for joining a "restricted" event. Once user sends request for a restricted event, the request is pending and will be either accepted or denied by host. As host, user have full control for its events. It can set up time, address, number of guests allowed, etc, and deny/accepted users' requests.

We found that a common use case is that companies doing tech talks at universities can greatly leverage a website like Foodent. They can create open invite for tech talks and encourage people to join. Another use case is that users wanting to make friends can use Foodent to invite people to his/her home very easily.
